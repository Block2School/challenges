## The goal of this challenge is to find out the operations you'll have to do

You are given 3 lines:

- On the first line you'll receive:
  - `A` -> An Integer between `1` and `30`
- On the second line, you'll receive:
  - `B` -> A letter
  - `C` -> A letter
- On the last line you'll receive:
  - `D` -> An Integer between `1` and `30`
 
⚠️ ** Constraint ** ⚠️

`A` >= `D`

`1` <= `D` <= `A` <= `30`
 
### ℹ Here are a few examples, given the inputs and outputs you have to find out what to do ℹ
 
## Here are a few example to help you :
